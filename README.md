# Preambles
A collection of LaTeX preambles, that roughly serve the following purposes:

- **base.sty:** core math packages, formatting, useful universal commands
- **cats.sty:** *ca*lculus/sta*ts* macros for integrals, series, probability
- **linalg.sty:** linear algebra macros for matrices, vectors, etc
- **boxes.sty:** tcolorbox environments
- **logic.sty:** commands for logicians
- **gruvbox.sty:** gruvbox styling for lstlistings

and some others I don't use that much but are just here.

Also throwing my UltiSnips snippets in here because I don't want to lose them.
